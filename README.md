# Missile-Path-Calculator
The Missile Path Calculator is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to simulate and visualize missile trajectories, blast radii, and damage zones. This interactive tool allows users to input missile specifications, select a military or naval base, and set a target destination. The application calculates the missile's path, blast radius, and damage zones, displaying the results dynamically on an interactive map.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive GUI powered by Tkinter makes it easy to input missile specifications and destination coordinates.

Geolocation Integration: Utilizes geocoding services to convert destination addresses into precise geographic coordinates.

Real-time Visualization: Dynamically calculates and displays the missile's trajectory, blast radius, and damage zones on an interactive map using Folium.

Educational Tool: Provides a valuable educational resource for understanding missile trajectories and the impact of different missile specifications on affected areas.
